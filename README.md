During this lab we were tasked with using build in classes from both bootstrap and tailwind to replace the  css we usually interact with ,it takes some getting used to for both these frameworks but when you do get the hang of it these are good tools to have.The classes you can use are many and not so easy to memorize best bet is to search for the one you need 

My favourite class to use under bootstrap is fixed-bottom. getting a footer to stay at the bottom is usually a challenge but with these classes it was seemless. 

on the other hand im more of a fan of tailwind, it adds a certain layer of detail to classes that you can specify as you see fit like being able to specify the shade of a color for example bg-blue-300 is lighter than bg-blue-800 

As for react it was okay to use though for mobile development id rather stick with react native which i almost the same as base react just it has specified tags and element you can use to specify what you want. the ease of styling is the same and much easier than styling a website made using html. As long as everything needed is nested in a return function.
